### What's wizzer?
wizzer is a Python module to help programmers initialise their domain specific
variable(s)/configuration(s) using a wizard-like question answer chat scenario.
The need for this module began to develope when there was such need for
Intent-Based Networking (IBN). Where the user would express their intention and
expect the system to translate and trigger setup automatically.
### How to use?
You can make the file usable as a script as well as an importable module. See example1.py
